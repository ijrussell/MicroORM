Introduction
============

This solution was prepared for a NxtGenUG (http://www.nxtgenug.net) session at Hereford (September 2011).  

It shows some of the capabilities of three of the most popular micro-ORMs;

	Massive by Rob Conery
	Dapper.Net by Stackoverflow
	Simple.Data by Mark Rendle

The examples are in no way exhaustive but do show the most common functionality required for Data Access.

Please feel free to modify and extend this code to your hearts content.

Installation
============

Install Chinook.sql (Sql Server 2005+) [Version 1.3]
Install Procedure.sql into the Chinook database.

Each project has a connection string that will probably need changing to reflect your installation.
